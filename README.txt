    This is my blog about US politics. I recently decided that I am going to start this blog because I think it will be a good use of time. I have noticed that I have been spending a lot of time just "laying around", and I want to do this to change that.
    The blog I am doing will be called the "Blexas Blog". I will not come out with this blog online on my Twitter account because I want to get more content to post. The word Blexas is an abbreviation for "Blue Texas". I have had a Twitter account about this topic for a while now. I think now is a good time to start acting. Unlike other blog projects, I will do my best not to abandon this one.
    Blexas is the moment that Texas turns blue. It has not happened yet, and a Democrat has not won statewide to date in the 21st century, though that will change. But this blog is about more than that (and I am not a Texan).
    What I want to do with this blog is write about big issues that are happening as well as upcoming elections. My Twitter handle is #VoteBlueEveryElection, and I would like to talk about every election on this blog. The blog will involve HTML resources as well.
